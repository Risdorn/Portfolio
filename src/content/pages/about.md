## Rishabh Indoria – ML / AI Engineer

**Greetings!** I'm an **ML/AI Engineer** focused on building **end-to-end intelligent systems**, from data ingestion and modeling to deployment and real-world integration. My work spans agentic **AI**, **computer vision**, and **applied machine learning**, with an emphasis on robustness, scalability, and practical impact.

Across my projects, I’ve built systems involving **knowledge graphs with reasoning**, **Vision Transformers under resource constraints**, and **predictive models trained on large, noisy datasets**, bridging the gap between ML research concepts and production-ready implementations.

## Core Expertise

### Machine Learning & AI

- Deep Learning, Classical ML
- NLP, Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Systems
- Computer Vision, Vision Transformers

### Systems & Engineering

- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- FastAPI, ML model serving
- End-to-end ML pipelines & inference systems

### Data & Modeling

- Feature engineering (numeric, categorical, text)
- Large-scale dataset handling
- Model evaluation & optimization

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I enjoy tackling complex, ill-defined problems and turning them into clean, reproducible, and deployable solutions. Whether it’s optimizing models for latency, designing fault-tolerant pipelines, or simplifying complex ML workflows, I prioritize clarity, reliability, and impact.

## Continuous Learning

The ML landscape evolves quickly, and I continuously explore new architectures, tools, and ideas, particularly in agentic systems, transformers, and scalable ML engineering, to improve both model performance and system design.

## Collaboration and Communication

I value clear communication and structured collaboration. Building strong AI systems often requires aligning ML, engineering, and product thinking. I enjoy working at that intersection.

## Get in Touch

Interested in agentic AI systems, applied ML, or production-grade AI pipelines?
I’m always open to conversations around meaningful ML work and real-world AI deployment.

_Let’s build intelligent systems that make an impact!_
